Files included in the zip:
-ipquoridor.c : Contains the bulk of all the functions and the main function.
-This README file.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The AI works best with the white player, so it would be best to run the program with the black player being
the naive player.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No arguments to the command line are required.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please bear in mind that any walls that are closing the player have to be undone via the undo command,since
this program does not contain such a function.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also please consider that the program may often encounter errors while cooperating with the referee. However,
the program will defeat the naive player almost always if it completes successfully.
